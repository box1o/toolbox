# Camera Intrinsics and Extrinsics

Intrinsics:
- Focal Length (fx, fy)
- Principal Point (cx, cy)
- Distortion Coefficients (k1, k2, p1, p2, k3) (optional)
- Skew Coefficient (s)

represent the internal parameters of the camera that affect how images are formed.


Extrinsics:
- Rotation Matrix (R)
- Translation Vector (t)

represent the external parameters that define the camera's position and orientation in the world coordinate system.

for the convention of the camera extrinsics, we follow the right-handed coordinate system where:
- The Z-axis points forward from the camera.
- The X-axis points to the right.
- The Y-axis points downwards.
